# Permutations and Combinations Calculator

A simple web application that allows users to calculate the number of permutations and combinations for a given set of values $n$ (total items) and $r$ (items to be chosen or arranged). Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🔢 Features

- Input fields for total items (n) and selection/arrangement items (r)
- Calculates:

  - Permutations $P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$
  - Combinations $C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}$

- Instant results displayed on the same page
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
